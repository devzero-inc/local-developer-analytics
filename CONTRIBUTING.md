Contributing to LDA Project
===========================

We welcome contributions and are thrilled you're considering contributing to the LDA project. This document outlines the contribution process and how you can report issues or help improve the code.

Issues
------

* **Issue Tracker**: Use the GitHub issue tracker for any bugs or feature suggestions related to the program code.
* **Support Queries**: For support-related questions, please, instead of opening an issue, reach out directly via GitHub discussions or the contact email provided in the README.
* **Existing Issues**: Before submitting a new issue, please search the existing issues to avoid duplicates. Utilize the search tool with keywords related to your concern.
* **Issue Descriptions**: When opening a new issue, be as clear and detailed as possible. Utilize the default issue template provided on GitHub to ensure all relevant information is included.
* **Debug Information**: If you're reporting a malfunction, providing debug mode outputs can be immensely helpful. Instructions for enabling debug mode are available in the project documentation.

Pull Requests
-------------

* **Code Contributions**: We use pull requests (PRs) for contributions to the codebase. This includes bug fixes and enhancements.
* **Feature Proposals**: For substantial changes or new features, we recommend opening a discussion first, either through an issue, GitHub discussions, or direct communication. This allows for community input and guidance before significant effort is undertaken.
* **Documentation Updates**: If your changes necessitate updates to the documentation, please include those in your PR.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LDA project. Your efforts help make this project better for everyone.
